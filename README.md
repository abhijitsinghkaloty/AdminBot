# CS50-bot

Hello, world!

For my Final Project, I have decided to make a discord bot for moderation. There are few fun commands like welcome, hello, avatar, ping, whois and members.
The other commands can only be used by administrators in the server. For example, there is the kick command, the ban command, the mute and unmute commands, the slowmode
command, the purge command and finally the nickname command. The main goal of my bot is to ease the moderation because it can be difficult to maintain
discipline in a discord server.
