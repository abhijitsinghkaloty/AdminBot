# About the discord bot

Hello, world!

For my Final Project, I have decided to make a discord bot for moderation. The main goal of my bot is to ease the moderation because it can be difficult to maintain
discipline in a discord server.There are few fun commands like welcome, hello, avatar, ping, whois and members. For example, the ping command gives the bot ping in the server. On the other hand, the whois command gives a members information (like when the account was creaated, when they joined the server, etc.)
The other commands can only be used by administrators in the server. For example, there is the kick command, the ban command, the mute and unmute commands, the slowmode command, the purge command and finally the nickname command.

# Description

This project was only coded in javascript. First of all, I had to make an application on the Discord Develper Portal and then, I invited my bot to my discord server. I installed Visual Studio Code 2 and I've downloaded node.js and discord.js afterwards (Discord.js is the documentation for the bot). I then made a json file to store the data of my bot. Finally, before making the commands, I made an index.js file which handles the app startup and other functions.

# How to use

To start my bot I have to type "node ." in my terminal. Once the bot is online, I have to add the prefix "." before a command to make it work.
